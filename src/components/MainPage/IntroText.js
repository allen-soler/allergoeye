            <p>We use decades of experience in medicine and biomedical image analysis to develop new
                approaches for the automation and objective quantification of medical tests which are
                currently conducted in a subjective and/or qualitative manner. Our current focus are allergy
                tests, for which we develop innovative products for the quantitative evaluation of allergic
                reactions.</p>
