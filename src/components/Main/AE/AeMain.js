                        AllergoEye (CE certified as a 93/42/EWG class 1 product) is an automatic system based on
                        artificial intelligence and neural networks, developed using the latest machine learning /
                        deep learning methods. The conjunctival provocation test offers a fast, simple and highly
                        sensitive method for allergy recognition, however it lacks objective qualitative measures.
                        AllergoEye solves this problem by offering qualitative and quantitative measurement and
                        analysis of the scleral allergic reaction. The system documents the acquired results, allowing
                        for longterm comparison and access.
