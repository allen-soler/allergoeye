After applying the allergen solution to the patient’s eyes, the eyes are captured with the smartphone camera by using the included face mask. The eyes are shot in three positions: straight, right and left side. The images are then transferred to the computer, where the sclera is automatically detected and the eye redness score calculated, determining the strength of the reaction. Any archived tests can be accessed for comparison and development analysis. The results can be exported to external statistical softwares or as written reports."
